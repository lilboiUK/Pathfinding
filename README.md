## Pathfinding in Unity ##
This repository contains a simple Unity implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. 
It finds the shortest path between two points in a maze represented by a sprite texture. 
The algorithm supports 8-directional movement (including diagonals) and visualizes the path on the maze.
